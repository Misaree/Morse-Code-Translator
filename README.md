# Morse-Code-Translator
In this project, I have made a morse code translator using Arduino. Here, we have simulated the code using wokwi, the link for which is as attached in the text file. 
In the project, the user enters a morse code in dots and dashes and the output generated is in english alphabets and if the user enters an english alphabet then the code generates the output in morse code. The code for the same is as attached in the file.
